## Overview

PokerVision streamlines the process of collecting and analyzing hand histories. Built on Python with a Tkinter GUI, it leverages a local SQLite database to store comprehensive details for each hand, enabling detailed profit analysis, positional insights, and performance tracking.

Below are a few screenshots of the interface:
